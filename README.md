# Networked-Game

	This is a game we called 'Type-RacingÂ®'. After running the server, users can use the client to connect to the servers IP. NOTE: if you are not port-forwarding your router for the www, be sure to use the servers internal IP and users can connect as long as they are in the same network. You may type 'XXX' to use local host.

	Created for the Computer Networks bonus assignment at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

	This project is open to the public.
